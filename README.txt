Drop Zone is a web page template designed for static pages, or at least those with a lot of text. It combines:

* Yahoo!'s reset.css from their awesome Core CSS library.
* Blueprint CSS for super-straight columnar layouts.
* CSSStickyFooter so you can stay fresh down there.

All available for you to download.
