Drop Zone is a great place to start when you need to put together a web site. It's great because it sets you up with:

* Yahoo!'s reset.css from their Core CSS library
* Blueprint CSS's default grid.css for super-straight columnar layouts
* CSSStickyFooter so you can stay classy

It does all of this so you can get a-markin' up.
